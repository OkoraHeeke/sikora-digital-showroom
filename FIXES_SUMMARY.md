# Fixes Applied for Wire & Cable Line Scene and Product Loading

## Issues Fixed

### 1. GLB Loading with DracoLoader Support
**Problem**: The `neuelinie.glb` file was not being loaded in the 3D scene, and there was no proper GLB loading component with DracoLoader support.

**Solution**:
- Updated `Scene3D.tsx` to import `useGLTF` from `@react-three/drei`
- Created a new `GLBModel` component that uses `useGLTF` to load GLB files
- Updated `ProductionLineModel` to use the new `GLBModel` component
- Fixed asset path handling to use `/api/assets/` endpoints correctly
- Added fallback functionality for when GLB loading fails

### 2. Products Not Loading from Database
**Problem**: Products were not being displayed for measurement points in the ConfigurationSidebar.

**Solution**:
- Updated `ConfigurationSidebar.tsx` to accept and display `products` prop
- Added product selection and configuration functionality
- Updated the Products tab to show available products for selected measurement points
- Added "Configure" buttons to assign products to measurement points

### 3. Product 3D Models Not Appearing in Scene
**Problem**: When products were configured to measurement points, their 3D models weren't being loaded in the scene.

**Solution**:
- Updated `Scene3D.tsx` to accept a `products` prop with product data
- Modified product rendering logic to use actual `Object3D_Url` from database
- Fixed URL path handling for product models
- Added proper product lookup functionality

### 4. Asset Path Issues
**Problem**: Asset URLs in the database contained "public/" prefix which didn't match the API server's asset serving endpoints.

**Solution**:
- Updated image URLs to replace "public/" with "/api/"
- Fixed GLB model URLs to use correct API endpoints
- Updated Scene3D to handle different URL formats correctly

### 5. UI Structure Optimization *(Updated)*
**Problem**: The user wanted a cleaner interface with products on the right side instead of tabs in the left sidebar.

**Solution**:
- Removed Overview and Products tabs from left ConfigurationSidebar
- Left sidebar now shows only measurement points with enhanced information
- Moved product selection and configuration to the right DetailsPanel
- Added comprehensive measurement point details (position, status, configuration)
- Enhanced product display with better layout and configuration options
- **NEW**: Removed descriptive text section from left sidebar for cleaner look

### 6. Limited Product Selection *(New)*
**Problem**: Only very few products were shown for measurement points due to restrictive database queries.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced API logic in `DB/api-server.js` for `/api/measurepoints/:id/products`
- Now tries three levels of product filtering:
  1. Products linked via measurement parameters
  2. Products allowed for the specific scene
  3. All products (up to 50) excluding explicitly blocked ones
- Significantly increased product availability for measurement points

### 7. Category Tags Removal *(New)*
**Problem**: Product category tags were displayed in product views but should only be used for search functionality.

**Solution**:
- Removed category tag display from `DetailsPanel.tsx`
- Categories are now only used internally for product search and filtering
- Cleaner product presentation without visual clutter

### 8. Multi-language Support *(New)*
**Problem**: Application was only available in German.

**Solution**:
- Created `LanguageContext.tsx` with German/English support
- Added language selection in Header with flag icons
- Integrated translations throughout `ConfigurationSidebar.tsx`
- Added `t()` translation function for easy text management
- Measurement points now show names in selected language
- All UI text is now translatable

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/Scene3D.tsx**
   - Added `useGLTF` import for GLB loading
   - Created `GLBModel` component with proper error handling
   - Updated product rendering to use database URLs
   - Fixed asset path handling

2. **src/components/ConfigurationSidebar.tsx** *(Extensively Updated)*
   - Removed tabs and simplified to measurement points only
   - Enhanced measurement point information display
   - Improved visual indicators for configuration status
   - Added more detailed position and status information
   - **NEW**: Removed descriptive text section
   - **NEW**: Added comprehensive multi-language support
   - **NEW**: Display measurement point names in selected language

3. **src/components/DetailsPanel.tsx** *(Updated)*
   - Added product selection and configuration functionality
   - Enhanced measurement point details view
   - Added comprehensive product display with images and descriptions
   - Integrated configuration buttons and status indicators
   - **NEW**: Removed category tags from product display

4. **src/components/Header.tsx** *(New)*
   - **NEW**: Added language selection with German/English flags
   - **NEW**: Integrated with LanguageContext
   - **NEW**: Translated header text and product catalog button

5. **src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx** *(New)*
   - **NEW**: Complete language management system
   - **NEW**: Translation function with fallbacks
   - **NEW**: German/English language support

6. **src/App.tsx**
   - Updated component props to support new UI structure
   - Removed tab-related state and handlers
   - Enhanced product data flow to DetailsPanel
   - **NEW**: Integrated LanguageProvider wrapper

7. **src/types/index.ts**
   - Removed `activeTab` from ConfiguratorState interface

8. **DB/api-server.js** *(Updated)*
   - **NEW**: Enhanced product filtering logic for measurement points
   - **NEW**: Three-tier fallback system for product availability
   - **NEW**: Increased product limit from 10 to 50 for fallback scenarios

## How It Works Now

1. **Scene Loading**: When a line type (cable) is selected, the system loads scene data including the `neuelinie.glb` file as a static object.

2. **Measurement Point Selection**: Left sidebar shows all measurement points with enhanced details (position, configuration status, importance indicators).

3. **Product Display**: When a measurement point is selected, the right DetailsPanel shows:
   - Detailed measurement point information
   - **MANY MORE** available SIKORA products for that measurement point
   - Configuration options and status
   - **NO** category tags (cleaner presentation)

4. **Product Configuration**: Users can configure products directly from the DetailsPanel with immediate visual feedback.

5. **3D Visualization**: Configured products appear as 3D models at the measurement point locations in the scene.

6. **Multi-language Support**: Users can switch between German and English in the header.

## Testing

The API server is working correctly:
- `/api/health` - Returns status OK
- `/api/assets/neuelinie.glb` - Serves the GLB file correctly
- `/api/measurepoints/1/products` - **NOW RETURNS MANY MORE PRODUCTS** (10+ vs previous 3-4)
- `/api/scenes/1/complete` - Returns complete scene data with static objects

The application now features:
- **Much more comprehensive product selection** for measurement points
- **Multi-language support** (German/English)
- **Cleaner UI** without unnecessary descriptive text and category tags
- Clean, focused UI with measurement points on the left
- Comprehensive product selection and configuration on the right
- Enhanced measurement point information and status indicators
- Smooth workflow from measurement point selection to product configuration
- Full 3D visualization of the configured production line
